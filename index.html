    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    

    <p>Welcome, to my personal webiste, where you will be introduced to my dear adopted pet, Mia. Mia was born on July 4, 2020.  I adopted 
        her in September of 2020. Mia is one charasmatic kitty, that has more energy and will than most cats that I have met. 
        Her favorite thing to do is reside in my backyard and the climb trees to hunt birds.  She has gotten lucky quite a few times.
        Watching her is a fun activity.  Her hunting skills are elite. When it is nighttime, I let her inside the house, and she 
        becomes very sad. However, she sits and watches her kingdom throughout the night and sees what prey and even predators visit her territory.
        Even though Mia is a ruthless hunter, she is a loving pet.  She shows she misses me when I come back from out of town.  She also loves to spend
        time with me while she is outside.  Anytime I pet or cuddle her she purrs for an endless amount of time.
        Mia not only finds comfort in me, but I also find happiness through her. </p>
